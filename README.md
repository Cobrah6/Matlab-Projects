This code reads data from a folder containing and subfolder and within that subfolder they are other folders containing different data for different 16 students.
Here we are calculating the forces on the air craft wing which is a neccersary for Aerodynamics in understanding the stresses the wing can withstand.
An assumption that all these forces were acting in the wing spar was made as it's the core support of the wing.
These calculations were then separated into functions with each function serving for a specific calculation.
This data was then stored in s structure array with different filds with is a Force and Moment Fields.
Within this structure array the wing was checked if it will bend due to the forces exerted upon it, and thbis information was stored in an array.
The data belonged to 16 different students.
